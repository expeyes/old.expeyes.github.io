    <h3>Measuring Capacitance</h3>
    <p>ExpEYES Junior can measure capacitance in the pico Farads range. The
      capacitance between IN1 and GND terminals are measured by using an
      internal constant current source.Measurements are done with and without
      connecting the capacitor, to subtract the stray capacitance. Figures below
      show measurement of a parallel plate capacitor and a 20pF dipped mica
      capacitor. </p>
