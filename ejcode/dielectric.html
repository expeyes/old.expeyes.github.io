    <h3>Dielectric Constant</h3>
    <p> Dielectric constant of ordinary windows glass is measured. A capacitor
      is made by pasting aluminium foils on both sides to make a capacitor. The
      dimensions are 13 cm x 10.6 cm x 0.4 cm and the measured capacitance is
      225pF. The dielectric constant calculated is 7.38. This experiments can be
      repeated using other insulating materials. </p>
