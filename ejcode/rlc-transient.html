    <h3>Transient Response of LCR Circuits </h3>
    <p> The transient response of LCR circuit is studied by applying a 5-&gt;0
      volts step and measuring the voltage change across the capacitor. Resonant
      frequency and damping are extracted by fitting the data with the equation
      of a damped sinusoid. For and inductor of 130 mH (with a coil resistance
      of around 600 Ohms) and a capacitor of 0.1 uF, the circuit shows
      under-damped response. </p>
