    <h3>Cooling of Water</h3>
    <p> Temperature of cooling water is recorded as a function of time, using a
      PT100 temperature sensor. The experiment is repeated with coloured water,
      by adding some potassium permanganate. Resistance of PT100 sensor is a
      function of temperature. It is connected to a constant current source and
      the voltage drop is amplified and recorded. </p>

    The rate of cooling for clear and coloured water is almost identical.<br>
