                    <p>The PHOENIX project started in 2005 and many people, both
                      from <a href="http://www.iuac.res.in/indexhighres.html">IUAC</a>
                      and outside, has contributed at various stages. Only those
                      who have worked in developing equipment are mentioned
                      below. Equally important are the numerous members of the
                      academic community who took interest in it and worked for
                      spreading it, by conducting programs and also introducing
                      it to the syllabus at some places.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Introduced the idea of using <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/111/pramode.html">Python
                        language for Phoenix</a> , something that had a
                      tremendous impact on the project. Suggests new ideas and
                      solutions and also works for spreading awareness about the
