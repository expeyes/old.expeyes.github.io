                    Computer programmers and hobbyists at times come across
                    situations where they need to switch a light bulb, rotate a
                    motor or measure a temperature under software control.
                    Generally these things are done by connecting some extra
                    hardware to the computer and coding it in C language.
                    KuttyPy is a USB interfaced board that gives you an option
                    to do those things in pure Python.<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Playing with LEDs, motors,
                    switches etc. is the primary objective of this hardware, but
                    the experience gained in manipulating the 32 Input/Output
                    pins of this board will gradually make you familiar with the
                    ATMega32 micro-controller. That is only the secondary
                    objective for a "kutty" (means child in some languages).<br>
                    The hardware, firmware and software resources are <a href="https://github.com/expeyes/expeyes-programs/tree/master/kuttyPy">HERE</a>.</span></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
            style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The board provides
            32 terminals that are organized in to 4 groups, each having 8
            terminals, namely A, B,C and D.&nbsp; </span>The individual
          terminals are marked as PA0 -- PA7 for port A, PB0 -- PB7 for port B
          etc. They can be controlled/monitored as a group or as individual
          pins. The following example gives some idea about the system.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Blinking LED </span><br>
        </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
          simplest thing to start with is to control LEDs connected to any of
          the terminals. Connect an LED from PB0 to Ground with 5k resistor in
          series, for current limiting. The LED should blink when you run the
          Python program <a href="code/blink.py">blink.py</a>.</span></p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Let
          us examine the code line by line:<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">from kuttyPy import *</span><br>
          This line imports the kuttyPy module ( kuttyPy.py should be in your
          working directory). This module gives you&nbsp; functions that can
          read/write the Registers of the micro-controller connected to the USB
          port.&nbsp; This line also searches for the hardware on the available
          USB ports. If nothing found, the program is terminated.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(DDRB,255)</span><br>
          DDRB is an 8bit Register that decides the direction of the terminals
          PB0 -- PB7. If a bit is 1, the corresponding terminal becomes an
          output. If it is zero, the terminal becomes an input. DDR stands for
          Data Direction Register. The last letter represents the port, for
          example DDRA decides the direction of port A.<br>
          <br>
          time.sleep(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; , for a one second wait<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(PORTB,255)</span><br>
          PORTB is an 8bit Register where you set the output level of the
          terminals PB0 -- PB7. If a bit is 1, the voltage at the corresponding
          terminal becomes HIGH, else it becomes LOW. Here we are making all the
          terminals HIGH, means LED conected to any of them will glow.&nbsp; In
          a similar manner you can use PORTA, PORTC and PORTD.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(PORTB, 0)</span><br>
          As explained above, PB0 to PB7 will be set to LOW.<br>
          <br>
          Running this loop makes the LEDs connected to any of the terminals PB0
          to PB7 will blink. The frequency will be decided by the delay
          specified in time.sleep()<br>

          stepper motor by controlling the coils from PA0 -- PA3</span><br>
