    <title>Gravity by TOF</title>
  </head>

    <h3>Gravity, by time of flight</h3>
    <p> Acceleration due to gravity can be calculated by measuring the time
      taken by an object to fall under gravity from a given height. A metal ball
      is held by an electromagnet powered by OD1. A loudspeaker generates an
      electrical signal when the ball hits the surface. It is amplified and
      given to SEN via a PN junction diode. The time from a falling edge on OD1
      to a rising edge on SEN is measured using software. </p>
    <p>The value of g is given by g= 2*h/t^2. The time is measured within one
      millisecond error.
      The experiment is repeated with different heights to eliminate the
      systematic error due to the finite time taken by the coil to release the
      ball. </p>
