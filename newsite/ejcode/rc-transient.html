    <h3>Transient response of RC Circuit</h3>
    <p> Transient response of RC circuits are studied. The voltage changes
      across the capacitor after applying a step voltage through a resistor is
      plotted. The RC time constant is calculated by fitting the discharge curve
      with the equation. The capacitor charging is exponential only when it is
      through a linear element like a resistor. </p>

    <p> The voltage across a capacitor changes linearly when charges through a
      constant current source. Connect to CCS instead of OD1 and click on CC
      Charge to get the output shown below. After 3 volts the graph is not
      linear due to the limitations of the current source. </p>
