    <h3>Period of a Pendulum, value of 'g'</h3>
    <p> Period of oscillation of a pendulum can be measured by allowing it to
      intercept a beam of light falling on a photo-transistor. The LED is
      powered by SQR1 and the photo-transistor collector is connected to SEN,
      which goes to the internal analog comparator of the micro-controller.
      Oscillate the pendulum and measure the time period between alternate
      interceptions, count only for one direction. </p>

        to light LED<br>
        for k in range(10):<br>

    <p>Acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from the period measured.
      Since we have used a rod pendulum, the relation</p>
    <p>is g = 4 * pi * pi * L / (T*T) = 4*pi**2*15.4/.6432**2*2/3 = 979.7</p>
    <p>Don't get exited with the accuracy of the result. It might have come
      closer to the actual value due to the error in measuring the length. What
      really maters is the small spread in the measured value. The frequency
      change due to large amplitudes can be easily observed.</p>
