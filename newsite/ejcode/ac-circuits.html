    <h3>Steady state response of LCR elements to applied AC voltage </h3>
    <p> ExpEYES can be used to study the effect of resistive, inductive and
      capacitive elements in an AC circuit. L,C and R are connected in series.
      The total voltage and the voltage across the resistor are measured as a
      function of time. The voltage across LC is obtained by subtracting the
      voltage across R from the total. The phase relationships and the vector
      diagrams are graphically displayed.</p>
    <p>Resistor = 1000 Ohm,&nbsp; Inductor = 300 mH, 5Ohms , Capacitor = 1 uF </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase shift calculated using the above values is
      40.8 deg (calculator on the right bottom side) and the measured Phase
      shift is 40.1 deg, well within the tolerance values of the
      components. </p>
