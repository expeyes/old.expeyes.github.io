    <h3>AC mains pickup </h3>
    <p>The AC mains supply waveform can be plotted by using a piece of wire as
      an antenna (NO direct contact with AC power line). The frequency is
      extracted from the captured waveform, by fitting it with the equation of a
      sinusoid. Connect one end of a long piece of wire to A0 and let the other
      end float near a power line. The amplitude of the signal will depend upon
      the length of the wire and its proximity to the power line. Try doing this
      using a laptop, far away from AC power lines.</p>
